Audiophole scripts collection I use on audio-pc

Foreword
--------

I am using audiophile windows 8 edition with all not audio and network
related services disabled.  

I've build a computer for a JPlay software requirements: Corei7 and
16G RAM. But that program did't met the expectations. I did't felt any
difference in comparation of JPlay and this scripts. Additionlly Jplay
blocks all pc action in hibernate mode, so one more computer is needed
to comfortable use it. And that is too much!  

So now there are ~14Gb spare RAM. I am thinking about using it for
a RAM drive and automatically load albums in it. This will allow to
disable network service till switch to other album. But this should be
automated for comfortable usage.

Warning
-------

Current version is tightly coupled with software i am using. You will
need to edit .bat files for your needs before usage.

And _if you find better way of optimizing PC, create and issue there
or send me a pull request!_

Installation
------------

1. Put startup_user.bat to current user autoload.
1. Schedule startup.bat to load on login (it will be run with admin rights).
1. Enjoy music.
